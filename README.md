# MAE199

The task of automating of blood glucose regulation can be done through artificial means for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Much of the literature regarding this problem of T1D implements approaches rooted in control theory; however, with the increasing popularity and viability of artificial intelligence in a multitude of applications, the set of pragmatical solutions to this problem now extends into the realm of machine learning.

[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) is an open source Python library used in various deep learning applications. We use PyTorch to build and train our neural networks; to see some example notebooks of our Deep Q-Networks (DQN), refer to [kyadamos/notebooks](https://github.com/kyadamos/MAE199/tree/main/notebooks).
